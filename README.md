This is a project for [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd004) provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). 

In this project, I should build a Movie Trailer Website where users can see movie information as well as watch the trailers. As required, I first write server side code to store a list of movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer URLs using Classes. These movie information is further processed to dynamically generate an HTML file, which is the Movie Trailer Website.

To run the application, simply:  

1. Download the source code and unzip it
1. Run entertainment_center.py in the main folder

All Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc. that I referred to or used are listed in "references.md".
